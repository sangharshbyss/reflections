How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
- It tells me about what additions have made to new file. I can check only those line to see if I have made any typo. Same with the information I have deleted. It highlights the files which I have deleted so I look at those lines and can check if I have deleted any importatnt information by mistake. It saves lot of time and energy as I do not need to go through the whole file looking for bug. The bug was not there before so I just need to check the changes which I have made. And function "diff" makes it easy.
